I am a Ph.D. student in [Human-Computer-Communication Laboratory](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/laboratories/human-computer-communications-laboratory)
in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. [Helen Meng](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-meng-mei-ling-helen/), started from Aug, 2019. 
I was an intern in the Speech and Language Processing group in [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/index.html), supervised by Dr. [Fei Mi](https://mifei.github.io/) and Dr. [Yitong Li](https://lrank.github.io/), collaborating with [COAI group](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) from Tsinghua University on **safety issues in dialogue systems**.
Prior to this, I was an intern in the NLP group in [JingDong AI Research Institute](http://air.jd.com/) working on task-oriented dialogue systems.

## :microscope: Research Interest

My research mainly focuses on buidling reliable dialogue systems in terms of safety concerns (biased and offensive languages, moral considerations, etc.) and knowledge grounding.
I am also interested in general ethical issues in NLP applications, e.g., fairness of large language models.
You are more than welcome to :envelope: me for research discussions!
